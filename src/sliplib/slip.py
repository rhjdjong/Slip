Constants
---------

.. data:: END
.. data:: ESC
.. data:: ESC_END
.. data:: ESC_ESC

   These constants represent the special bytes
   used by SLIP for delimiting and encoding messages.

Functions
---------

The following are lower-level functions, that should normally not be used directly.

.. autofunction:: encode
.. autofunction:: decode
.. autofunction:: is_valid

Classes
-------

.. autoclass:: Driver

   Class :class:`Driver` offers the following methods:

   .. automethod:: send
   .. automethod:: receive

   To enable recovery from a :exc:`ProtocolError`, the
   :class:`Driver` class offers the following attribute and method:

   .. autoattribute:: messages
   .. automethod:: flush
